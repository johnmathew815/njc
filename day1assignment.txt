DAY 1--7/5/2020

----------


1) Explain SDLC at a high level

A: The various stages in the software development is referred to as SDLC.

they are: 

planning  or requirement analysis  : is one of the most important phase--product owner gets to interact with the clients and plans the variosu aspects of the project--
various aspects like eho will be the end user and what really is gonna be the product are all planned in this stage--
initial risk identifications are also done in this stage. 

design : deigns are made i.e logical design(how the general components fit together) or physical design(like DB schemas) adn these desiigns will be reviewed
 
coding : anothet imp stage--real building of s/w starts here--codind is done that build the core of the s/w

testing : its the stage where the s/w is tested. Various tests like unit,integration, load test(makes sure that the s/m can take laods) etc are done in this phase.

deployment: s/w is actually released to the production env for users to use them.

maintenancece : maintenenance after deloyment of the s/w--patching of s/w is also done



2) What is waterfall and why it is still relevant

A:   its a s/w development model that is linear and sequential--
	 various stages are: req gathering, designing, coding , testing,deployment and maintenance--
	  any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete--
	  
	  it is relevant when :
	  
	  @ Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed.
	  @ Technology is understood and is not dynamic.
	  @ There are no ambiguous requirements.
	  
	 advantages:

		@ Simple and easy to understand and use
		@ Phases are processed and completed one at a time.
		@ Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.

	 disadvan:
	 
		@ Cannot accommodate changing requirements.
		@ Not a good model for complex projects.
		@ No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
		@ time to market is vey less






3) Explain Agile Model with a use case and the role of SCRUM in that


A:		its an iterative based s/w development model-- every iteration contains the stages of waterfall model--
		 during each iteration a small end result of the entire software is released until the final iteration with complete release--
		 feedback is also gathered from the client at the end of each iteration--

		use case: lets take the example of a messaging app say, telegarm--a small version of it is released in the first iteration followed by--
		other features in the second iterationa and so on until complete app or s/w is developed
		
		can be implemented using scrum, kanban, XP(xtreme programming)
		
		
		



4) Who is Scrum Master

A:    One of the main member in the scrum team--who manages everything--
	  clears obstacles--so that the team can work effectively--
	  ensuring good relationship b/w the team and the product owner--
	  addressing team dynamics
	  

	scrum board: story(entire backlog)->to do->in progress->to verify->Done(the working part of the s/w)
	


5) Differentiate between Product/Sprint Backlog


A:  in a scrum product backlog is the entire product requirement that has to be worked on--
	since scrum works in sprints, sprint are created and delivered after every period of time--
	say, a small part from the product  backlog is taken and bamed as the first sprint and this is then worked on
	followed by the next sprint and if the previous sprint isn't completed within the estimated time then that one--
	alos gets added to the current sprint being worked on!
	
	Sprint: A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work--
	Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies--
	and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.  
	


6) What is Epic & Story

A:	An Epic can be defined as a big chunk of work that has one common objective. 
	It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement--
	stories are small parts of the epic which are actually broken down from epic--
	The stories tell the arc of the work completed while the epic shares a high-level view of the unifying objective.



7) What is called Velocity in SCRUM

A: It is the amout of work a team can do during a single sprint--
	it is calculated at the end of the sprint by totalling the points for completed user stories.--
	
	It is an indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned--	 
	into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team
	
	


8) Explain the SCRUM ceremonies

A:  Sprint: already discussed in Q5


	Sprint Planning : the work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. 
	This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
	
	Daily Scrum: it is a 15 min daily stand up meeting that is done to talk about the next plans and objectives to be done in the--
	next 24 hours--scrum manager manages the meeting in here
	
	Sprint Review : in sprint review different topics and features about the completed sprint is discussed
	
	Sprint Retrospective : here the team talks about the completed sprint and the improvements that can be made in the upcoming sprint


9) What is grooming

A:	Grooming (or refinement) is a meeting of the Scrum team in which the product backlog items are discussed and the next sprint planning is prepared.--
		ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery.--
		This activity occurs on a regular basis and may be an officially scheduled meeting or an ongoing activity.--



10) How Jira board is effective in SCRUM

A:	Jira is a tool used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management--
	jira board contains the info about the current sprint and its features--
	this helps in effective communication b/w the team members--
	it also enriches the upcoming sprint planning--
	improves team focus
	


11) Differentiate between SCRUM & Waterfall

A: 

	SCRUM: it is the methodology with which agile model is implemented--
	various steps in scrum are product backlog--sprint planning--
	sprint backlog--then the implementation of the sprint along with scrum meetup--
	sprint review and then the increment part--after all this a sprint retrospective is also carried out
	
	product backlog conatins the entire product requirement in it and from this a part that could be potentially deployable--
	is taken to the sprint backlog and worked on for delivery--the sprint backlog is implemented by the scrum team that consists of cross-functional members--
	scrum master also plays a major role by managing and organising everything--after the completion of this the sprint is taken for review--
	various faetures of the sprint is discussed--and the increment is given(i.e a potentially deployable product)--
	followed by the sprint retrospective in which the comments are made about the currently completed sprint and also what could be made better in the upcoming sprint etc.
	
	waterfall:
		@When the requirements from the product are clear and have a picture of the result.
		@The customer is very clear, and requirements are well defined and understood, does not require changes.
		
	scrum:
		@when the client specifications aren't clear	
		@When the freedom to take a decision is needed by the developer and the stakeholders. 
		Options are provided to them so that they can take decisions independently. No fear of failure
	
12) Explain the responsibilities of Product Owner

A:  it is the person that represents the firm and talks to the client--
	he creates the product backlog--
	 is responsible for maximizing the value of the product--
	also makes sure that the development team understands the product backlog clearly
